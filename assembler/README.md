## Part 0 (Assembler)

### How to run
1. The assembler can be easily run with any given input file. The program takes the first argument on the command line as the filename. For example on Linux - 
```bash
java -jar Assembler.jar input.txt
```

2. The program produces two files as an output, `listing.txt` and `loading.txt`, which are the listing and loading files respectively.
