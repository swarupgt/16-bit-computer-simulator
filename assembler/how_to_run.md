## Part 0 (Assembler)

### How to run
- **The program takes the first argument on the command line as the filename.**
- The assembler can be easily run with any given input file. For example on Linux - 
```
java -jar Assembler.jar input.txt
```

- The program produces two files as an output, `listing.txt` and `loading.txt`, which are the listing and loading files respectively.
